# AI Fact Checker

AI Fact Checker is a website where a user asks a question, and it returns the claims made in the question with factual information. It leverages the use of Gemini AI (search tool).

## Larger Picture
It will be built for cross-devices (website/Android/iOS) where the input will be people's voice, which gets translated to text, and concurrently, the app will provide the claims and factual information. The claims will be colourized in red and green to indicate if the claim is correct or not. Red denotes the claim is False and green denotes the claim is True.

## Use Case
Consider you are in a debate and you are on the audience side. The debaters start speaking and then speak out a lot of information with data. You don't know what the current data is, and the speaker might mislead the audience. This app will solve that issue. The app will find the information from reliable sources and then put it on the screen so that it will be easier to fact-check instantly.

**Example:**  
&emsp; **Speaker**: The world's population is 8.2 billion. The population is declining at a faster rate, which is contributing to global cooling.
